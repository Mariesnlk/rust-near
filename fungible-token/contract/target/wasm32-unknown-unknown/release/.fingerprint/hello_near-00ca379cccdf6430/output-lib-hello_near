If using Cargo, add it to `[dependencies]`\n  in Cargo.toml.\n- The crate is present, but under a different name. If using Cargo, look for\n  `package = ` under `[dependencies]` in Cargo.toml.\n\n## Common causes for missing `std` or `core`\n\n- You are cross-compiling for a target which doesn't have `std` prepackaged.\n  Consider one of the following:\n  + Adding a pre-compiled version of std with `rustup target add`\n  + Building std from source with `cargo build -Z build-std`\n  + Using `#![no_std]` at the crate root, so you won't need `std` in the first\n    place.\n- You are developing the compiler itself and haven't built libstd from source.\n  You can usually build it with `x.py build library/std`. More information\n  about x.py is available in the [rustc-dev-guide].\n\n[rustc-dev-guide]: https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/building/how-to-build-and-run.html#building-the-compiler\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"src/events.rs","byte_start":3357,"byte_end":3366,"line_start":108,"line_end":108,"column_start":10,"column_end":19,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"#[derive(Serialize, Debug)]","highlight_start":10,"highlight_end":19}],"label":"can't find crate","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":{"span":{"file_name":"src/events.rs","byte_start":3357,"byte_end":3366,"line_start":108,"line_end":108,"column_start":10,"column_end":19,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"#[derive(Serialize, Debug)]","highlight_start":10,"highlight_end":19}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},"macro_decl_name":"#[derive(Serialize)]","def_site_span":{"file_name":"/Users/mariesnlk/.cargo/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/serde_derive-1.0.163/src/lib.rs","byte_start":2511,"byte_end":2569,"line_start":92,"line_end":92,"column_start":1,"column_end":59,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"pub fn derive_serialize(input: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {","highlight_start":1,"highlight_end":59}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}}}],"children":[],"rendered":"\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9merror[E0463]\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m: can't find crate for `serde`\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m   \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m--> \u001b[0m\u001b[0msrc/events.rs:108:10\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m    \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m108\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m#[derive(Serialize, Debug)]\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m    \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m| \u001b[0m\u001b[0m         \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9m^^^^^^^^^\u001b[0m\u001b[0m \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;9mcan't find crate\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m    \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m    \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[38;5;12m= \u001b[0m\u001b[0m\u001b[1mnote\u001b[0m\u001b[0m: this error originates in the derive macro `Serialize` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)\u001b[0m\n\n"}
